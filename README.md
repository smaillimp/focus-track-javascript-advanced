# JavaScript Advanced focus track

This repository contains the slides, exercises and project instructions for the focus track.

The goal of the focus track is that the participants are able to build fullstack web applications with React and Node.js. The topics before React (npm and ES6) prepare them to work with those technologies. The ES6 exercises are chosen to cover the most used features in React (destructuring, map, filter, arrow functions).
