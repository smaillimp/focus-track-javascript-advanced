# JavaScript Advanced focus track

This repository contains the slides, exercises and project instructions for the focus track.

The goal of the focus track is that the participants are able to build fullstack web applications with React and Node.js. The topics before React (npm and ES6) prepare them to work with those technologies. The ES6 exercises are chosen to cover the most used features in React (destructuring, map, filter, arrow functions).

## Folder structure:

- [setup](./setup/README.md)<br />
  Contains the setup instructions for Node.js and npm.
- [slides](./slides/README.md)<br />

  - [npm](./npm/README.md)
  - [es6](./es6/README.md)

    - [react/part-one](./react/part-one/README.md)
    - [react/part-two](./react/part-two/README.md)
  - [nodejs](./nodejs/README.md)
- projects:<br />
  Contain the instructions for the two projects:
  - [projects/frontend](./projects/frontend/README.md)<br />
    This folder also contains the [deployment instructions for the project backend](./projects/frontend/backend/backend-setup.md). The backend has to be deployed, before the participants can work on the frontend project.
  - [projects/fullstack](./projects/fullstack/README.md)

## Project solutions (private repos):

The goal of the projects is that the participants apply the skills they learned with the theory and the exercises. The project solutions are for the focus track instructor and should not be given to the participants.
