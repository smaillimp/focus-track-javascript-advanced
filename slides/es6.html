            ## What is ES6?
            * EcmaScript is the name of the JavaScript standard
                * A standard is a set of rules people agree on
                * The EcmaScript standard defines what is possible in JavaScript
                * Browser developers (for example at Google) then implement those rules into the JavaScript runtime (the place where JavaScript is executed)

            ---

            ## What is ES6?
            * ES6 is version 6 of the JavaScript standard
            * It is supported by all modern browsers: See [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=es6)

            ## ES6 repetition
            * In the first part of the bootcamp, we already looked at parts of the new ES6 features
            * Example: let and const, arrow functions, classes
            * As those features are important for the React part, therefore we will repeat it in this focus track
