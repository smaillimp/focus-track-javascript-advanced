            ## What is Node.js?
            > Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. (https://nodejs.org/en/)
            * Node.js lets you run JavaScript outside of your web browser
            * When you install Node.js, you install the Node.js CLI as well as **npm**

            ---

            ## What is npm?
            * Online repository for JavaScript projects
            * Package installation and version management

            ## What is npm?
            With npm you can manage foreign code used in your project.

            Examples: React, jQuery, TypeScript, etc.

            ---

            ## Installation
            See [setup guide](https://github.com/Powercoders-International/focus-track-javascript-advanced/blob/main/setup/README.md)

            ---

            ## How to get started?
            * Create a new folder
            * Navigate into the folder with your CLI and run the following commands:
            ```
            npm init -y
            npm install cowsay
            ```
            * Open the folder in VSCode and inspect package.json

            ---

            ## How to get started?
            * cowsay is a package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cowsay)
            * You installed cowsay into your project
            * It is now listed in package.json as a dependency (code which your code needs in order to work)

            ---

            ### Use cowsay package in CLI:

            * In package.json replace the existing script with the following script:
            ```
            "scripts": {
                "my-first-script": "cowsay npm is cool"
            }
            ```
            * In your CLI, run the following command:
            ```
            npm run my-first-script
            ```

            ---

            ### Use cowsay package in browser:

            * Create an HTML file
            * Add a script tag with the source: "./node_modules/cowsay/build/cowsay.umd.js"
            * Add a script tag with the following content:
            ```
            console.log(cowsay.say({
                text: "npm is cool"
            }));
            ```
            * Open the website in your browser

            ---

            ## Node.js and npm
            * We now can use JavaScript in our Browser and in our CLI

            ---

            ## package.json
            Is used to manage the project and the foreign code in the project
            * `scripts` help us to automate tasks
            * `dependencies` lists foreign code and its version
            * `devDependencies` contains foreign code we only need for development

            ---

            ## npm and git
            * The foreign code is downloaded to a folder called `node_modules`
            * The files `package.json` and `package-lock.json` define, which code and which version is downloaded
            * The `node_modules` folder can be deleted and then recreated by only using the two package.json files
            * Therefore, the `node_modules` folder does not need to be tracked with git

            ---
            ## npm and git
            Exclude the `node_modules` from being tracked:
            * Create a file `.gitignore`
            * Add the following content:
            ```
            node_modules
            ```
