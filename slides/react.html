            ## Quiz part 1

            ---

            What is a component?

            ---

            ### Component
            A piece of the UI that we can reuse.

            ---

            What are props?

            ---

            ### props

            Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
            <small>https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html</small>

            ---

            What is useState?

            ---

            ### useState

            As React rerenders (executes) a component many times, state can not be stored in "normal" variables. `useState` helps to preserve state even when the component rerenders.

            ---

            ### useState

            Additionally, it triggers a rerender.
            ```
            useState(0) -> 0 is displayed on the screen
            click updates state to 1 -> rerender
            1 is displayed on the screen
            ```

            What is useEffect?

            ---

            ### useEffect

            The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects. <small>https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html</small>

            A side effect is code which affects something outside of your component.
            * network requests
            * manipulate the DOM directly
            * setTimeout (uses a browser API)

            ## Single Page Application

            A single-page application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets (such as JavaScript and CSS) required for the application to run. Any interactions with the page or subsequent pages do not require a round trip to the server which means the page is not reloaded.

            ## Single Page Application

            Though you may build a single-page application in React, it is not a requirement. React can also be used for enhancing small parts of existing websites with additional interactivity. Code written in React can coexist peacefully with markup rendered on the server by something like PHP, or with other client-side libraries. In fact, this is exactly how React is being used at Facebook.
